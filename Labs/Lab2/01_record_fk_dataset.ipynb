    "The goal of forward kinematics is to find out where the robot's feet are from the joint angles we read from the robot. You'll do this by implementing a `forward_kinematics(q)` that takes in the joint angles (12-D) and return four 4x4 transformation matrices that represnt the pose of the feed frame in the robot's body frame (look at `02_fk_implementation.ipynb`). Since implementing this function might take you some time, in this notebook we ask you to record some dataset from the real robot so you can use them back home to validate your work. Next week you will usa your `forward_kinematics(q)` to do some fun experiments with the real robot! \n"
