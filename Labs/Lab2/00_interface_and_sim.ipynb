    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In lab1 you learned how the robot is controlled with ROS2 and how to run and tune a basic PID controller. Now that you are familar with this ROS based interface, we wrap everything into two easy-to-use `RobotSim` and `RobotReal` classes so you can focuse on how to make the robot do interesting things while these two classes take care of the ROS2 in the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to get you familiar with this new interface and and guid you along the installation process on your laptop so you can simulate the robot on your own when you're not in the lab. By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start the robot simulator on your laptop and read its states and send joint commands\n",
    "- Launch the robot bridge on the hardware and communicate with it with your laptop! \n",
    "- Visualize the real robot's motion in the simulator app. \n",
    "- Implement basic control loops and record datasets of robot's state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start!\n",

    "# Installation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to have Anaconda (or miniconda) installed on your laptop. After installing it, open the conda terminal and run the following command to create a virtual environment and install the lab's repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "cd path/to/NYU_ROB_2004\n",
    "git pull # Make sure you synchrionize your fork with the master branch before pulling to get the latest updates\n",
    "conda create --name rob2004 python=3.10 # When prompted, accept the terms \n",
    "conda activate rob2004\n",
    "pip install -e . # Make sure you are in the repositorie's root directory before running this\n",
    "```\n",
    "If everything is done correctly, you should now have the lab's software stack installed!\n",

    "# Launching the Simulator App\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the rob2004 installed on your laptop, we should be able to simulate the popper in MuJoCo. First, check for the simulator app installation by running the following in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate rob2004\n",
    "rob2004-simulator --help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the application is installed correctly, you'll get an output like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "usage: rob2004-simulator [-h] [--visualizer] [--fixed_body] [--port PORT] [--ip IP]\n",
    "\n",
    "ZeroRPC Popper Mujoco simulator and visualizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "options:\n",
    "  -h, --help    show this help message and exit\n",
    "  --visualizer  Visualizer mode (Physics disabled)\n",
    "  --fixed_body  Fix the robot's body in the world.\n",
    "  --port PORT   The network port on which the simulator server listens\n",
    "  --ip IP       The IP on which the simulator server listens\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you use a Mac computer, the command above does not work. In Mac you need to run the simulator using `mjpython` instead of the normal python interpreter. Do this by navigating to the repository directory and then runnign the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd path/to/NYU_ROB_2004\n",
    "conda activate rob2004\n",
    "mjpython scripts/simulator_app.py --help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is correct, you'll see the same help information as shown above. As printed in the help message, the simulator app has two important flags. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `--visualizer`: In this mode, the physics simulation is disabled and we use the app as a visualizer (for example mirror the real robot in the virtual world)\n",
    "- `--fixed_body`: If you set this flag, the robot's body will be fixed in the world as if you have it sitting on the stand. In future labs you'll diactivate this flag to let the robot walk around in simulation!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the app as a visulizer of the current state of our real robot so launch the app as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rob2004-simulator --fixed_body --visualizer # or mjpython scripts/simulator_app.py --fixed_body --visualizer \n",
    "```\n",
    "If everthing is done right, you'll see a window like this:\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"assets/mujoco_sim.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"50%\" height=\"auto\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that in the terminal, you'll see a message indicating that the simulator is running and waiting for you to connect to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Simulator is running on port 4242. Use RobotSim(port=4242) to communicate with the robot!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We use this information to connect to the simulator in our python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. First mport the `RobotSim`:"
